# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project uses **machine learning** to classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** â€” based on their **sepal and petal measurements**. It's a classic introductory project for data science and classification tasks.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known multivariate dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher. It contains **150 samples** with 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample is labeled as one of three species of iris flowers. The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately classifies a flower's species based on these features.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Understanding the structure of the dataset
   - Visualizing relationships between features

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical labels
   - Splitting the dataset

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Decision Tree / K-Nearest Neighbors (optional)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
